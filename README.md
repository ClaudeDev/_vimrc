# _vimrc
My _vimrc optimized for Web Devs
This is a _vimrc so it is for Windows users (yes, it is obvious by the name).

I remapped jk to ESC, you don't have to remap capslock or any other remapping, just press jk in rapid succession to change mode.
Here are some Plugins that I find really useful for web development in VIM:

0)PATHOGEN
https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
Well it is the most simple and powerful plugin ever created, just copy the plugin folder in the bundle folder and you are done.

1)EMMETT
https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim/
You already know it, you already love it. But you have to press Ctrl-y and , to activate it on VIM!
I missed a lot the tab of Sublime so I wrote a workaround in my .vimrc that you can find here:
Now you just press ,, and you are done. You are welcome.

2)YOUCOMPLETEME
https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#windows
This is the best autocomplete plugin for VIM, it will autocomplete most of the programming languages and it’s really useful for Javascript. Now you have and IDE like VIM.

3)ALE
https://github.com/w0rp/ale
Forget SYNTASTIC, ALE is the new king. ALE works in an asynchronous way and it uses all the possibilities that Vim 8 introduced. It is much faster and performant than syntastic.
It can use different linters. I suggest ESLINT and FLOW for javascript.

4)VIM-JAVASCRIPT
 https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript
To solve some indentation problems.

5) VIM_INDENT_GUIDES
https://github.com/nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides
I like this plugin because it gives you a very visual and immediate way to see the Tree.
